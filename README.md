# US cities and corresponding states Python dictionary
The ipython notebook file `US City to State dictionary.ipynb` contains the code used to make the dictionary and discusses its limitations.

I have also included a module file from which the dictionary can be imported using:
```
from city_to_state import city_to_state_dict
```
See also the `test.py` file for a simple example.
